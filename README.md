School

# Description

This is little PHP project where we emulate a school database with the students' table only where the main functionality is to fetch the students in a paginated fashion along with a search filter and some filter criterias.

## Side notes

1. We're using MySQL as a database
2. Name your database as "school_php" and create a "students" table
3. You don't have to insert the students records anymore since there's already a SQL statement for auto-insertion in the index.php
